# Sonic
### Ultrasonic Emitter

**Sonic** is a simple python program (now also available as an `.exe`) that allows
the user to adjust the sound emitted to the connected speaker or device 
between the levels of **0 - 100,000 Hz**.

---

#### **Update**
Sonic now includes an **amplification bar** that allows for sounds beyond what your computer is typically capable of producing.

**Download the executable**: [Sonic Standalone Executable](https://github.com/R-D-BioTech-Alaska/Sonic/tree/main/dist)

---

### Requirements
- The `Requirement.bat` is needed to run the `.pyw` file.
  (If `Requirement.bat` fails to execute, run `pip install pyaudio pyqt5 pydub pybluez pyinstaller` or the equivalent commands based on your setup.)
- The `.exe` file is standalone and located in the `/dist` directory.

---

### **Warning** :warning:
Please be aware that this program emits sounds that can be **harmful and dangerous** to both people and animals. The levels permitted by this device are able to cause hallucinations.


---

### How to Use
1. Download the appropriate version for your OS.
2. If using Python script, ensure Python is installed and run `Requirement.bat` to install dependencies.
3. Open the program and adjust the frequency and amplification as needed.
4. Use responsibly.
