# Sonic
Ultrasonic Emitter

Sonic is a simple python program (now also available as an exe) that allows
the user to adjust the sound emitted to the connected speaker or device 
between the levels of 0 - 100,000 hz.

***Update***
Sonic now has an amplification bar that allows for sounds beyond what your
computer is supposed to allow. 

The Requirement.bat is for the .pyw file. Exe is standalone located in /dis.

***Warning***

Please aware that this program emits sounds that can be harmful and dangerous 
to people and animals. The levels allowed on this device can cause hallucinations.
